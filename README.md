# simple-js-editor
Simple JavaScript code editor and executor.

I wanted to introduce editable and executable JS code snippets inside my [Reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/) presentations. This is (more or less) the result.

> [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) added, because it is inside [Reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/) as well.
